## ***Project Description***

 **Smart Toilet Cleaning Management System** that monitors the hygiene within the toilet and generate alerts or alarms for the staff members if the toilet requires any attention.

The toilet will be equipped with turbidity and gas sensors that monitor water quality and smell respectively. The turbidity sensor is measured in Nephelometric Turbidity unit (NTU) where high NTU value indicates the water is dirty, whereas the gas sensor (MQ2) detects the foul smell with high output voltage, and later sends a signal to the system to compare with the hygiene threshold and accordingly send the message/ email to the staff regarding the toilet being unhygienic and require immediate cleaning.
